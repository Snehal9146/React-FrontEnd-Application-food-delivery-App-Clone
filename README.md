# React FrontEnd Application - Food Delivery App Clone

This project is a clone of a Food Delivery Application, built using **React** and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It showcases a user-friendly interface for browsing food items, managing a cart, and checking out, all with responsive design.

## Features

- **Food Catalog**: Browse through a selection of food items with details and pricing.
- **Add to Cart**: Add items to your cart and review the total price before checkout.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **React Router**: Manage different pages like the food catalog and cart.
- **State Management**: Track the cart's state and items using React's state management.
